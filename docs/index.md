I am following the tutorials in [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) but writing the code in C for good practice.

here are a few really good resources by [Fabien Sanglard](https://fabiensanglard.net/about/index.html):

scratchapixel.com : Great raytracer lessons written by professionals that have worked on Toy Story, Avatar, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean and many other movies.
An Introduction to Ray Tracing : An old book but a Classic.
Physically Based Rendering : Heavy on maths but really good and well explained.
